    "Chord recognition in music has long been a topic of interest at the intersection of music and computer science. In this project, I attempt to create my own model that can accurately infer the chord that is being played at different points in a song, given the audio features of that song. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has been done before by a few significant research projects, so I began by reading these and learning about the techniques used. See these links if you're interested|: \n",

    "Although there are many different ways to approach chord recognition, I decided to begin with a simple approach using the scikit learn models we used in class this year with the [Billboard Datset](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/The_McGill_Billboard_Project_(Chord_Analysis_Dataset)/). This project is ultimately a classifier, so the McGill Billboard set is perfect because it provides both labels and features, already pre-processed, for the same set of songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "I downloaded two main directories from this dataset, one for the chord labels, and the other for the audio features (`chord labels` and `audio features`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The chord labels set contains a directory of about 1300 songs from the last century, with chord annotations in the LAB format (including their, start time, end time, and label). These are pretty simple to read-- they contain the root tone of the chord, followed by a colon, and then the version of that chord. This is what they look like: \n",
    "```\n",
    "1.8015782305999999\t3.529687074200001\tA:min\n",
    "3.529687074200001\t5.257795917800002\tA:min\n",
    "5.257795917800002\t6.985904761400003\tC:maj\n",
    "6.985904761400003\t8.714013605000009\tC:maj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio features set contains a directory for the same 1300 songs, but instead contains timestamps throughout the song, as well as the chroma features for that timestamp. As explained on the documentation site linked above, the set contains Non-Negative Least Squares (NLSS) chroma features. I didn't read too much into the specific methods used for this feature extraction and the preprocessing methods, but the representation generally works as follows (including details for those less familiar with music theory):\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the vast majority of music made in the last few hundred years, music is written and played under 12-Tone Equal temperment. This temperment is centered around the concept of an octave, which is the interval between two notes where one is double the frequency of the other. Two notes an octave apart are perceived to be the same note to humans, but with one tone being higher than the other. Thus, octave intervals are labeled as the same note. \n",
    "- Each octave interval is then divided equally into 12 notes, usually centered around a frequency of 440hz, which is marked as A4. Therefore, A3 has a frequency of 220hz, while A5 has a frequency of 880hz. Each interval between is divided equally, giving us A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, and G#. \n",
    "-Chroma features essentially divide all frequencies within a sound into these 12 notes, resulting in a 12-dimensional vector representing the strength of each 12-Tone note (in this case, the dataset contains 24-Dimensional vectors to span two octaves, since the labeling of chords containing the same notes can sometimes vary according to the distribution of these notes or relatively placement to one another). \n",
    "- The features in the dataset are adjusted for tuning differences between songs, so the frequencies will be directed to the correct chroma-bins. "

    "Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the outcome of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway that I have right now is that this is truly a resource-intensive project-- compiling the data for, training, and storing these models takes massive amounts of space and is very slow, even when I ran this on my PC. Even trying to save the Random Forest Model on *half* of the original dataset took 20GB. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there's not a real way around this-- unlike binary classifiers that are quite easy to run, there are a few hundred chord labels here, so having a huge set is pretty important. \n",
    "I tried very hard to work around this by enlisting my GPU for computation in addition to the CPU for model training, but my the setup wasn't working and I figured my time was better spent researching other ways to approach the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried training the LR and RF models on larger portions of the dataset, but this inevitably lead to repeated crashes related memory and storage issues. Therefore, I ended up reducing the set to 50% of its original size, which allowed me to actually train both models (while sacrificing some accuracy). \n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model from part 3a performed pretty poorly, only scoring 51% on the weighted f1. However, I made some dataframes comparing the predicted chords with the actual chords, and found that a lot of the time there were just minor errors, such as labeling a C:Maj as a C5 (which is just a Cmaj without the E (the 3)), or would get the root right but just identify another note as part of the chord when it was likely part of the melody. Thus, I decided to test the accuracy of the model's predictions at just guessing the root note of the chord, which the logistic regression scored 80% on (weighted f1). This wasn't bad at all, for a basic model at least. \n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest did much better, scoring a 66% on the weighted f1. I did the same method on the RF as I did for the LR to see the accuracy of the model only considering the root notes, and it scored over 85% correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers aren't extremely high, but I'm very satisfied with them given the simplicity of the model and the complexity of this task. The leading research teams in the past 10 years were very excited to get accuracy scores in the mid 70s, even using myriad other techniques to achieve higher accuracy. I looked into trying some of these, but a lot of them are extremely complicated-- such as Hidden Markov Models to incorporate transition probabilties and use the sequence of chords to infer subsequent chords. These are very cool to read about, but actually finding the data for a model like this and implementing it effectively would've been a much larger project than this one. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also would've liked to have tried to infer the chord transition times without supervision, but I read into this and also determined it would be a many-hour type of task, so I decided to do the changes manually to test a few songs on my own. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end (Part 4), you can see the functions I wrote to use the model on 3 different songs-- Here Comes the Sun- The beatles, Dancing in the Moonlight- King Harvest, and Vanilla Tobacco- Eloise. I did these in order of increasing difficulty and differences from the songs in the billboard set, and my predictions were correct. Here comes the sun was incredibly accurate-- I was able to play along with the song nearly perfectly using just the outputs from my model (If you look up the chord sheet for this online, it's usually a transposed version in D that is easier for noobie guitar players, so don't compare it with mine. It is in A.). It was also a pretty standard pop song format with familiar instruments, simple bass lines, etc., which made it easier for the model. Dancing in the moonlight was pretty good as well, but was a little worse than Here comes the sun. There were a decent amount of errors from the model, but they were usually errors that were pretty close to the correct chord- either sharing roots or other important tones. Lastly, Vanilla Tobacco was pretty tough. I suspect some of this was due to the inaccuracy generated from me trying to tap my keyboard as the song played so it would perfectly capture only the correct snippets. Furthermore, the song uses a fair amount of unrooted voicings (this essentially means a shape that is harder to accurately recognize for a model like this), and I think the instrumentation probably also made it a bit harder. She also sings loudly and does a lot of scatting which completely throws of the chromagram. The model got a few of the chords right here, but as I suspected, this song pushed its limits. \n",

    "Although I didn't get to do any of these on this project since they are much more complex issues, I am interested to try and implement the use of some sort of sequence-based model such as an HMM to help with this, as well as other more advanced pre-processing for more accurate reads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly though, this model would be a lot more effective if generated with access to more computing resources-- a much larger dataset or perhaps even genre-specific models would be extremely helpful, and this isn't really possible without massive amounts of ram and stable GPU integration. \n",
